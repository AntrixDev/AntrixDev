#Hey there üëã

I'm Annie, a programming student from Krak√≥w, Poland, passionate about creating innovative tech.

I‚Äôm in my third year at a technical high school (technikum), studying to become a software developer. I‚Äôm learning **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML** for web development, **Python** for AI and scripting, and exploring **C++**, **C#**, **React**, **PHP**, and **SQL** for various projects. 
Am I learning too many languages at the same time? Maybe..


### What I‚Äôm Working On??
- Crafting **websites** and **AI-powered assistants** to enhance user experience.
- Developing small interactive elements for websites to make them more unique.
- Experimenting with personal projects to sharpen my skills (feel free to check out my repos).

Outside of coding, I‚Äôm into **calisthenics** for strength, **video games** for inspiration (Check out Dead As Disco), and following **AI** and **tech advancements** to stay ahead of the curve.

I'm so excited to grow and contribute to the tech community.
Thanks for visiting! (‚Äæ‚ó°‚óù)
